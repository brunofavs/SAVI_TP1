The program is a Face Recognition system, that also uses tracking.

## **Features:**
- Detect multiple faces
- Recognize all faces from either a pre-existing or a realtime updated database
- Show the used database for recognition in realtime
- Identify recognized faces, and add unknown ones to the database
- Greet known faces with "Hello", using TTS (Text to Speech)
- Ask for identification of an unknown face detected, using TTS and the terminal
- Track every person and maintain a tracker over the person, even when not recognizable.


## **Usage:**

Enter 'src' directory and run main.py on the terminal. Every time the program asks to identify a new person, their name should be inputed in the terminal, then press Enter. (((((((((((To open and view the database, press 1. To exit the program press Escape.)))))))))))

## How does it work?
